# 🧩 Sudoku Solver – Python Project

## 📝 Overview

This is a **Python-based Sudoku Solver** built using the backtracking algorithm. It efficiently solves any standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle by filling in missing values while ensuring the game rules are met. The project showcases algorithmic thinking and Pythonic implementation of classic constraint satisfaction problems.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Accepts Sudoku puzzles with empty cells (zeros)
- ⚙️ Uses backtracking to recursively solve the grid
- 📋 Validates each number placement according to Sudoku rules
- 🖨️ Neatly prints the solved Sudoku grid in the console
- 🧪 Can handle multiple puzzles with quick response time

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Basic I/O and recursion**
- **No external libraries required**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kryptoadi/SUDOKO-SOLVER-Python-Project.git
cd SUDOKO-SOLVER-Python-Project
```

### 2. Run the Solver
```bash
python sudoku_solver.py
```

### 3. Sample Puzzle Format
The puzzle is represented as a 2D list of integers in the script:
```python
board = [
    [7, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9],
    ...
]
```

## 🎯 How It Works

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Tries all possibilities for each empty cell. If it finds a conflict, it backtracks and tries a different number.
- **Validation Function**: Ensures that each number placed does not violate Sudoku rules for its row, column, or 3x3 grid.
- **Recursive Solving**: The main function continues placing numbers until the board is complete or all possibilities are exhausted.

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Solved Sudoku Board:
[7, 8, 5, 4, 9, 6, 1, 2, 3]
[6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 8, 4, 9]
[3, 4, 9, 2, 1, 8, 6, 7, 5]
...
```
